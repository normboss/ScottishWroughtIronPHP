                    Create an input field for each piece of data you wish to collect
                    To create an input field you can use a tag such as this: -->
                    <!--<input type="text" name="fieldname" size="25">-->

                    <!--For example if you wanted to create a input field called fullname it would look like this: -->
                    <!--<input type="text" name="fullname" size="25">-->
                    <!-- <label for="first_name">First Name *</label>

                    <!-- <label for="last_name">Last Name *</label>
                    <input maxlength="50" name="last_name" size="40" type="text">  -->
                    <label for="email">Your Email Address</label>

                    <input maxlength="80" name="subject" size="40" type="text">
                    <!-- <label for="telephone">Telephone Number</label>

                    <!--Customizing the default subject line 
                        You can customize the default subject line by using this hidden tag and replacing 
                        subject with what you want the subject to be 
                    -->

                        all you need to do is replace "Subject" in your code with the NAME of the field surrounded by %%. 
                        For example, if your form contains a field named firstname, it would look like this
                    -->
                    <!-- <input type="hidden" name="subject" value="form submission from %%first_name%%"> -->

                    <input type="hidden" name="required" value="email,message">
                    <!-- For example, if you were making the field named emailadress and firstname, your tag would look like this 
                        Note: "required" must be in lower-case letters to be recognized by our processor; name="REQUIRED" may not work. <input type="hidden" name="required" value="emailaddress, firstname">
