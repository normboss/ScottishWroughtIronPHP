                I awake early totally recharged, physically and mentally
                from yesterday's many hard tasks. I always remind
                myself how lucky, thankful and blessed I am to be
                able to do what I do.<br><br>
                It never ceases to amaze me, how I can take this hot,
                hard and dirty work and turn it into a pleasurable
                pastime that I never tire of.<br><br>
                From the creative element to the financial bonus,
                the work is its own reward.<br><br>
                My advice - find something you can really love, and
                do it well no matter what anyone else may think.
                Be of service and true to yourself. Enjoy!<br><br>
